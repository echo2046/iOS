# AFNetworking源码探究（二十二） —— UIKit相关之UIButton+AFNetworking分类（五）

## 回顾

上一篇讲述了关于 `UIImageView` 的分类，用于下载图像。这一篇讲述关于 `UIButton+AFNetworking` 的UIButton的一个分类。其实看过上一篇的话，这一篇都是类似的，大家简单看一下就可以了。

## 接口

我们先看一下API接口

```

#import <TargetConditionals.h>

#if TARGET_OS_IOS || TARGET_OS_TV

#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END

#endif
```

其实这个接口主要包含四个模块：

* 获取图像下载器
* 下载图像
* 下载背景图
* 取消下载图像（包括图像和背景图）

## 获取图像下载器

下面我们就看一下获取图像下载器

```
/**
 Set the shared image downloader used to download images.

 @param imageDownloader The shared image downloader used to download images.
*/
+ (void)setSharedImageDownloader:(AFImageDownloader *)imageDownloader;

/**
 The shared image downloader used to download images.
 */
+ (AFImageDownloader *)sharedImageDownloader;
```

图像下载器是用runtime实现的。

```
+ (AFImageDownloader *)sharedImageDownloader {

    return objc_getAssociatedObject(self, @selector(sharedImageDownloader)) ?: [AFImageDownloader defaultInstance];
}

+ (void)setSharedImageDownloader:(AFImageDownloader *)imageDownloader {
    objc_setAssociatedObject(self, @selector(sharedImageDownloader), imageDownloader, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN_NONATOMIC);
}
```

## 下载图像

下面看一下下载图像的实现。

```
- (void)setImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                 withURL:(NSURL *)url;
- (void)setImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                 withURL:(NSURL *)url
        placeholderImage:(nullable UIImage *)placeholderImage;
- (void)setImageForState:(UIControlState)state
          withURLRequest:(NSURLRequest *)urlRequest
        placeholderImage:(nullable UIImage *)placeholderImage
                 success:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, UIImage *image))success
                 failure:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError *error))failure;
```

看一下实现

```
- (void)setImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                 withURL:(NSURL *)url
{
    [self setImageForState:state withURL:url placeholderImage:nil];
}

- (void)setImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                 withURL:(NSURL *)url
        placeholderImage:(UIImage *)placeholderImage
{
    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
    [request addValue:@"image/*" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Accept"];

    [self setImageForState:state withURLRequest:request placeholderImage:placeholderImage success:nil failure:nil];
}

- (void)setImageForState:(UIControlState)state
          withURLRequest:(NSURLRequest *)urlRequest
        placeholderImage:(nullable UIImage *)placeholderImage
                 success:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, UIImage *image))success
                 failure:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError *error))failure
{
    if ([self isActiveTaskURLEqualToURLRequest:urlRequest forState:state]) {
        return;
    }

    [self cancelImageDownloadTaskForState:state];

    AFImageDownloader *downloader = [[self class] sharedImageDownloader];
    id <AFImageRequestCache> imageCache = downloader.imageCache;

    //Use the image from the image cache if it exists
    UIImage *cachedImage = [imageCache imageforRequest:urlRequest withAdditionalIdentifier:nil];
    if (cachedImage) {
        if (success) {
            success(urlRequest, nil, cachedImage);
        } else {
            [self setImage:cachedImage forState:state];
        }
        [self af_setImageDownloadReceipt:nil forState:state];
    } else {
        if (placeholderImage) {
            [self setImage:placeholderImage forState:state];
        }

        __weak __typeof(self)weakSelf = self;
        NSUUID *downloadID = [NSUUID UUID];
        AFImageDownloadReceipt *receipt;
        receipt = [downloader
                   downloadImageForURLRequest:urlRequest
                   withReceiptID:downloadID
                   success:^(NSURLRequest * _Nonnull request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, UIImage * _Nonnull responseObject) {
                       __strong __typeof(weakSelf)strongSelf = weakSelf;
                       if ([[strongSelf af_imageDownloadReceiptForState:state].receiptID isEqual:downloadID]) {
                           if (success) {
                               success(request, response, responseObject);
                           } else if(responseObject) {
                               [strongSelf setImage:responseObject forState:state];
                           }
                           [strongSelf af_setImageDownloadReceipt:nil forState:state];
                       }

                   }
                   failure:^(NSURLRequest * _Nonnull request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nonnull error) {
                       __strong __typeof(weakSelf)strongSelf = weakSelf;
                       if ([[strongSelf af_imageDownloadReceiptForState:state].receiptID isEqual:downloadID]) {
                           if (failure) {
                               failure(request, response, error);
                           }
                           [strongSelf  af_setImageDownloadReceipt:nil forState:state];
                       }
                   }];

        [self af_setImageDownloadReceipt:receipt forState:state];
    }
}
```

这里和AFN中 `UIImageView` 以及 `SDWebImage` 中的调用形式都是一样的。这个和AFN中 `UIImageView` 的实现是类似的，也不多说了。

主要就是首先判断是否下载是否存在，如果存在，那么就return，取消下载。然后获取下载器和缓存，获取缓存中的图像，如果缓存图像存在，就进行回调，如果缓存图像不存在就开始进行下载。

## 下载背景图像

看一下调用接口

```
- (void)setBackgroundImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                           withURL:(NSURL *)url;
- (void)setBackgroundImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                           withURL:(NSURL *)url
                  placeholderImage:(nullable UIImage *)placeholderImage;
- (void)setBackgroundImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                    withURLRequest:(NSURLRequest *)urlRequest
                  placeholderImage:(nullable UIImage *)placeholderImage
                           success:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, UIImage *image))success
                           failure:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError *error))failure;
```

下面看一下实现

```
- (void)setBackgroundImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                           withURL:(NSURL *)url
{
    [self setBackgroundImageForState:state withURL:url placeholderImage:nil];
}

- (void)setBackgroundImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                           withURL:(NSURL *)url
                  placeholderImage:(nullable UIImage *)placeholderImage
{
    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
    [request addValue:@"image/*" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Accept"];

    [self setBackgroundImageForState:state withURLRequest:request placeholderImage:placeholderImage success:nil failure:nil];
}

- (void)setBackgroundImageForState:(UIControlState)state
                    withURLRequest:(NSURLRequest *)urlRequest
                  placeholderImage:(nullable UIImage *)placeholderImage
                           success:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, UIImage *image))success
                           failure:(nullable void (^)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError *error))failure
{
    if ([self isActiveBackgroundTaskURLEqualToURLRequest:urlRequest forState:state]) {
        return;
    }

    [self cancelBackgroundImageDownloadTaskForState:state];

    AFImageDownloader *downloader = [[self class] sharedImageDownloader];
    id <AFImageRequestCache> imageCache = downloader.imageCache;

    //Use the image from the image cache if it exists
    UIImage *cachedImage = [imageCache imageforRequest:urlRequest withAdditionalIdentifier:nil];
    if (cachedImage) {
        if (success) {
            success(urlRequest, nil, cachedImage);
        } else {
            [self setBackgroundImage:cachedImage forState:state];
        }
        [self af_setBackgroundImageDownloadReceipt:nil forState:state];
    } else {
        if (placeholderImage) {
            [self setBackgroundImage:placeholderImage forState:state];
        }

        __weak __typeof(self)weakSelf = self;
        NSUUID *downloadID = [NSUUID UUID];
        AFImageDownloadReceipt *receipt;
        receipt = [downloader
                   downloadImageForURLRequest:urlRequest
                   withReceiptID:downloadID
                   success:^(NSURLRequest * _Nonnull request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, UIImage * _Nonnull responseObject) {
                       __strong __typeof(weakSelf)strongSelf = weakSelf;
                       if ([[strongSelf af_backgroundImageDownloadReceiptForState:state].receiptID isEqual:downloadID]) {
                           if (success) {
                               success(request, response, responseObject);
                           } else if(responseObject) {
                               [strongSelf setBackgroundImage:responseObject forState:state];
                           }
                           [strongSelf af_setBackgroundImageDownloadReceipt:nil forState:state];
                       }

                   }
                   failure:^(NSURLRequest * _Nonnull request, NSHTTPURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nonnull error) {
                       __strong __typeof(weakSelf)strongSelf = weakSelf;
                       if ([[strongSelf af_backgroundImageDownloadReceiptForState:state].receiptID isEqual:downloadID]) {
                           if (failure) {
                               failure(request, response, error);
                           }
                           [strongSelf  af_setBackgroundImageDownloadReceipt:nil forState:state];
                       }
                   }];

        [self af_setBackgroundImageDownloadReceipt:receipt forState:state];
    }
}
```

这个实现原理就不都说了，和下载图像中是类似的。

## 后记

> 本篇讲述了UIButton+AFNetworking的UIButton的一个分类。分析了其下载器的下载、图像的下载以及背景图像的下载。
